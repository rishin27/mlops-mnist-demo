# Agenda 
### ML Lifecycle
    - Business Problem - Take OCR parser as an example
        - Data + Annotations ?
        - Modelling research - (yolov5, yolor, etc)
        - Notebook based training to confirm model+data hypothesis
    - Notebook to Engineering Readyness
        - Here we civilize the code, to a prod eng standard
        - Steps
    - Engineering Readyness to Deployment
            

## Green field ML Modelling
    ### How to get your data in order
    - Using DVC + S3 for data versioning
    ### Stages & parameter
    ### Experiment Tracking
    ### Metrics and Artifact tracking
## From Modelling to Production
    ### CICD ML Experiments
    ### Deploy to AWS sagemaker
    ### ML model management with AWS Async Inference server
